This is the first stable version of the IoT Technofeya server. It should be used to process your data from sensors, connected to microcontroller board like Wemos ESP32. 

I desided to make it Open Source to make possibilities to improve the server functional. 
You can use it for your project on your own webServer in the condition you will make not a very simple contribution to improve this project! You should make your branch and after some
work on the project create pull request to my project. Thanks for make it better!
